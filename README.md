# PhaserJS Experiments

# What is this?

This repo is simply a collection of simple experiments by [Anthony Mills](http://www.anthony-mills.com) using PhaserJS. An experiment might be aimed at trialling a new feature in the library. Another may be focused on testing out a new game mechanic. These "experiments" are not intended as fully fledged games, or production quality code and should be treated as such. 

Either way I am releasing my experiments as open source, so if you feel like you would like to play around or repurpose something here for your own projects feel free.

# Existing Experiments

* Octopus Video Overlay - An experiement intented to test the effect of using a sprite with transparent areas ( or windows ) to control the perspective of an underlying playing video.
* Inkscape Shapes - A random assortment of shapes drawn using Inkscape 0.91 then exported using the HTML5 Canvas feature. With a small amount of modification i.e adding the data to a sprite for use in Phaser.
