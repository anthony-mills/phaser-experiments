# PhaserJS Experiments

# What is this?

This repo is simply a collection of simple experiments with PhaserJS. An experiment might be aimed at trialling a new feature in the library.
Another may be focused on testing out a new game mechanic. These "experiments" are not intended as fully fledged games, or production quality code and should be treated as such. 

Either way I am releasing my experiments as open source, so if you feel like you would like to play around or repurpose something here for your own projects feel free.

# Credits
